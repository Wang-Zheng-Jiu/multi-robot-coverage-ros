# Multi-Robot-Coverage-ROS

With the emergence of technology in our daily lives, robots are being increasingly used for coverage tasks which were earlier considered too dangerous or monotonous to be performed by humans such as interplanetary exploration and search & rescue. Out of all the multi-robot coverage approaches, the frontier based approach is one of the most widely used. Most of the coverage approaches developed so far, face the issue of frontier duplication and require access to the maps of the environment prior to coverage. 

In this work, I have developed a new frontier based approach for multi-robot coverage in unknown environments. This new approach is scalable to multiple robots and does not require prior access to the maps. This approach also uses a new frontier allocation and robot coordination algorithm, which reduces the frontier duplication in the robots and improves the efficiency of robot coverage.
